# Bookings

Bookings represent an agreement between a Transportation Service Provider and a passenger. The booking confirms the **vehicle availablility** of a transportation service and the passenger **payment** to reserve access to the vehicle. Bookings are typically represented in the form of a ticket, whether physical or digital, but are distinct from the ticket itself.

## Booking options

When planning a trip, there may be multiple options that would deliver a passenger to their destination. As such, it is important that the TSP provide access to booking options via a programmatic API. In turn, MaaS providers display booking options to the end-user, allowing them to select the option\(s\) that best fit their needs and preferences.

## Booking actions

In addition to knowing what booking options are available, MaaS providers need to create and manage bookings on behalf of passengers. This includes the need to

* _create_ bookings, 
* _read_ details about existing bookings, 
* _update_ booking details, and, in some cases, 
* _cancel_ bookings.
