# Roaming

People's lives arent defined by the boundaries of transportation networks. In esssence, people often need to roam in order to fulfill many needs and desires.

Roaming poses unique challenges in the context of transportation. It is not simply sufficient for one provider to plan a network to anticipate demand. Rather, users expect to simply get from where they are to where they want to be without too much hassle or confusion, even when their trip crosses multiple municipalities or regions.

## Avoid creating silos

In the context of roaming, a **silo** is any service that is designed only to operate at the exclusion of other services. A high level goal of Mobility as a Service is to promote interoperability between providers, both at the Transportation Service level as well as the Mobility Service level.

## Data portability

In adition to being able to physically move between service networks, people have the right to move _virtually_ between service providers. In effect, people own and have the right to transfer their data from one digital service to another, possibly maintaining active service with multiple providers. This means that service providers should create digital interfaces where people can access their personal data and export or import the data in common formats.

[Data Transfer Project](https://datatransferproject.dev/) - formed to create an open-source, service-to-service data portability platform so that all individuals across the web could easily move their data between online service providers whenever they want.
