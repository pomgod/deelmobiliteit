# Identity

People want to gain access to transportation choices with as little friction and fragmentation as possible. Identity management, i.e. signing up for accounts, is a large source of both friction and fragmentation. Identity management should be simple and straightforward.

When creating an account with a new service provider, **people should only be asked to provide essential information**. This is for two primary reasons: **User Experience** and **Privacy.**

## User experience

Signing up for a new account sometimes involves filling in a lengthy form. This can feel fatiguing, and may lead to abandonment of the sign-up process.

Since Mobility Services often span multiple Transportation Service Providers, we want to make identity management feel effortless across providers. This implies that Mobility Providers take on the role of **Identity Management**, collecting essential information from end-users in as simple of a way as possible.

## Privacy

User information is shared with Transportation Service Providers on an as-needed basis. The justification for accessing user information should be part of a **data processing agreement** made between the Mobility as a Service Provider and the Transportation Service Provider. The reasons for data sharing should be clearly communicated to the end-user \(a.k.a. **data subject**\).
