# Privacy

People provide us with their personal information in confidence. As such, we have a responsibility to our users to steward personal information as a sort of [legal trust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_law).

Operating as a legal trust encourages us to make decisions that are favorable to end user privacy and integrity. It means we resist prevailing sentiment that sees people as a source of data to be harvested for market value. It also means we act with transparency, describing what data we collect, why and how we use it, and disclosing any breaches or misuse of data entrusted to us.
